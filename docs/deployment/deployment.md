The following documentation will guide you through the installation of an erxes project using <a href="https://www.docker.com/" target="_blank">**Docker**</a> on <a href="https://ubuntu.com/" target="_blank">**Ubuntu**</a> in order to use erxes. This the guideline will be dedicated to developers who is about to use erxes for their businesses only. If you want to customize or develop additional plugins on erxes, please go to <a href="https://docs.erxes.io/introduction/introduction">the developer installation guideline</a>.

Docker is an open platform that allows to develop, ship and run applications by using containers (i.e. packages containing all the parts an application needs to function, such as libraries and dependencies).

## Preparing the installation
---

erxes installation requires at least four software prerequisites to be already installed on your computer:

:::caution

Erxes code takes approximately 12GB storage space, make sure you have enough space in your device before going forward. 

:::

## Preparing the installation

### Prerequisites
- **Docker**
- **<a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-use-docker-on-ubuntu-20-04">Docker</a>** (v20.10.14 and higher) The 20.10.14 version is most recommended by erxes. Docker compose (v2.5.0 and higher)


### Installing on server

```
#!/bin/bash
echo -e "\e[1mStep 1 $now : Updating \e[0m"
sudo apt-get update -y
# nginx install
echo -e "\e[1mStep 1 $now : Installing Nginx \e[0m"
sudo apt install nginx -y
# docker install
sudo apt update -y
echo -e "\e[1mStep 1 $now : Installing docker \e[0m"
sudo apt install apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl software-properties-common -y
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -
sudo add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu focal stable"
apt-cache policy docker-ce
sudo apt install docker-ce -y

echo -e "\e[1mStep 1 $now : Installing certbot \e[0m"
sudo apt install certbot python3-certbot-nginx

#user config
#sudo su
#passwd ubuntu
#sudo usermod -aG docker ubuntu
#su - ubuntu

#docker-compose install
echo -e "\e[1mStep 1 $now : Installing docker compose \e[0m"
sudo apt-get update -y
sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.27.4/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
echo -e "\e[1mStep 1 $now : Installing nodejs \e[0m"
#new directory
sudo apt-get install nodejs -y
echo -e "\e[1mStep 1 $now : Installing awscli \e[0m"
sudo apt-get install awscli -y
echo -e "\e[1mStep 1 $now : Installing npm \e[0m"
sudo apt install npm -y
echo -e "\e[1mStep 1 $now : Instert your erxes project\e[0m"
sudo npm install -g create-erxes-app -y
create-erxes-app erxes
```

2. Run the following command to give a permission to `Install.sh` file. 

```
 sudo chmod +x install.sh
```

3. Run `Install.sh` file using the following command. 

```
 ./install.sh
```

:::Caution

While `Install.sh` is running, the field to insert erxes data will show up.
:::

4. Type the domain to the field says "Please enter your domain (localhost)".

```
  Example: erxes-test.com
```

5. Insert your hostname on Rabbitmq host (optional).

```
Example: erxes
```

6. Insert the hostname on Redis host (optional) as well.

```
Example: erxes
```

7. Redis port (6379) will be as default, so press enter.
8. Set up your password on Redis password (optional).
9. Elasticsearch url will be as default `localhost:9200`, so just press enter.
10. Here you have your erxes project successfully installed, then go to your erxes directory with the foloowing command.

```
 cd erxes
```

:::Info
See the latest version of npm erxes here https://www.npmjs.com/package/erxes

:::

11. Copy the text below instead of configs.json

```
{
   "jwt_token_secret": "strong_token",
   "db_server_address": "db_server_ip_address",
   "domain": "https://example.com",
   "elasticsearch": {},
   "redis": {
       "password": "strongest_password"
   },
   "mongo": {
       "username": "mongo_user",
       "password": "strongest_password"
   },
   "rabbitmq": {
       "cookie": "strongest_value",
       "user": "rabbitmq_user",
       "pass": "strongest_password",
       "vhost": "rabbitmq_host"
   },
   "plugins": [
       {  "name": "contacts" },
       {  "name": "inbox" },
       {  "name": "tags"  },
       {  "name": "cards" },
       {  "name": "segments" },
       {  "name": "integrations" }
   ]
}


```

12. This command installs a package, and any packages that it depends on.

```
npm install
```

13. Provide docker permission to your user.

```
su
usermod -aG docker erxes
su - erxes

```

14. Go back to your erxes directory with the following command.

```
 cd erxes
```

15. Run the following command in your erxes directory. 
```
docker swarm init
```

:::Note
Please note that the following actions can be done once you fully run your Database containers. 

:::

16. Run the following to start database containers

```
sudo npm run erxes deploy-dbs
```

17. Run the following to start application containers

```
   sudo npm run erxes up
```

18. See the generated docker services using the command below.

```
   docker service ls
```

19. Use the command below to view the finished docker containers

```
 docker ps -a
```

20. Copying below line code from docker-compose.yml

```
mongodb://username:password/erxes?authSource=admin
```

21. Copying this container url by using docker ps -a command

```
erxes-dbs_mongo.1.value bash
```

22. The mongo database must be started with a replica set.
    Use the following command to access the mongo database running docker container:

```
docker exec -it erxes-dbs_mongo.1.value bash
```

23. After trying running following command

```
rs.initiate()
```

Many times, it becomes "RS0: primary".
These commands are given as a replica set, and when done correctly, the mongo shell changes to "RS0: primary".

24. After completing the configuration on the mongo database, delete and restart the services through the docker network. First, do the database services.

docker stack rm erxes
docker stack rm erxes-dbs
npm run erxes deploy-dbs
npm run erxes up
npm run erxes up – –uis

:::Note
Containers are generated one by one, so wait until they finish reading.
:::

25. Check the log file in the erxes_gateway container to make sure the services are working properly.

```
docker logs -f erxes_gateway.1.value
```

If "plugin_name has no address value" is displayed, it is not connected to the database.

26. nginx .conf - ийг /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/ руу move хийх

```
sudo mv nginx.conf /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/

```

27. Go to /etc/nginx/sites-enabled. 

```
cd /etc/nginx/sites-enabled
```

28. Configure your nginx.

```
sudo nginx -t
```

29. Restart your Nginx.

```
sudo service nginx restart
```

30. Configure your Free Ssl.

```
sudo certbot –nginx -d domain_name
```

31. Insert your registered email address.
32. Please choose redirect option.

Try typing your domain on your browser to see if it's working.
