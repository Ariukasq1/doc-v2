The following documentation will guide you through the installation of an erxes project using **<a href="https://www.docker.com/" target="_blank">Docker</a>** on **<a href="https://www.apple.com/macos/monterey/" target="_blank">MacOs</a>**.

Docker is an open platform that allows to develop, ship and run applications by using containers (i.e. packages containing all the parts an application needs to function, such as libraries and dependencies).

## Preparing the installation

---

erxes installation requires at least four software prerequisites to be already installed on your computer:

:::caution

Erxes code takes approximately 12GB storage space, make sure you have enough space in your device before going forward.

:::

### Prerequisites
